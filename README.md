# Snook-Deep-into-the-jungle
In here you'll find everything I would like to share from the code of my game Snook: Deep into the jungle

This repository is a 'brag' on my work on Snook: Deep into the jungle. I will be sharing only parts of the code that I find interesting, having high level logic, complicated math, or just things that I'm proud of myself for coming up with.
These won't be even whole classes, just peeks into the code.
I will be explaining these parts of the code in high detail.

The code is written in c# language, using the game engine - Unity.

This whole project is entirely my own work, no partnerships have been made, no usage of code from any source apart from my brain alone.

It has been an absolute blast developing this game thanks for checking this out!
